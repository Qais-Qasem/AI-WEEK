# J.A.R.V.I.S. - High-Accuracy Face Recognition Gate

## Hackathon Project Submission

This project implements a state-of-the-art face recognition system based on the J.A.R.V.I.S. theme. It uses a pre-trained ArcFace model to generate face embeddings for robust and highly accurate 1:1 identity verification.

### Key Features

*   **State-of-the-Art Accuracy:** Utilizes the ArcFace model, achieving over **96.16%** accuracy on our validation set.
*   **Robust Face Detection:** Employs the `retinaface` detector to ensure high-quality face localization before recognition.
*   **Efficient Database:** Creates a pre-computed database of face embeddings for fast and scalable verification.
*   **Full End-to-End System:** A complete, demonstrable pipeline from a web user interface to a backend API decision.
